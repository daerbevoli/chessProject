Material Balance:
Assign values to each piece (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king). Traditionally,
pawns are valued at 1 point, knights and bishops at 3, rooks at 5, queens at 9,
and the king's value is not explicitly considered.

Piece Mobility:
Reward pieces for having more available moves.
For example, a knight in the center of the board generally has more mobility than a knight stuck in a corner.

Piece Coordination:
Encourage pieces to work together.
Pieces that control key squares or are positioned in a coordinated manner are often more valuable.

King Safety:
Penalize positions where the king is exposed or under threat.
Castled kings, especially behind a pawn structure, are generally considered safer.

Pawn Structure:
Evaluate the pawn structure, considering factors like pawn chains, isolated pawns, doubled pawns, and pawn islands.
Certain structures can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the context.

Control of Key Squares:
Reward control of central and key squares. Squares like d4, d5, e4, and e5 are often critical.

Development:
Favor positions where pieces are developed and contribute to the overall position.
Developing pieces early in the game is a common chess principle.

King's Pawn Shield:
Consider the presence of a pawn shield in front of the king, which can contribute to the king's safety.

King's Activity:
In the endgame, an active king can be a valuable asset.
Encourage the king to participate in the game when there are fewer pieces on the board.
